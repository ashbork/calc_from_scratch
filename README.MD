# Poorly made calculator

This little program is a calculator that can do basic math. I made it to learn a bit about parsing, tokenizing and the reverse Polish notation.
It doesn't catch all of the possible mistakes one might make and won't handle arbitrary input without issues. It doesn't support functions either,
but I may work on that later.

## Start guide

Clone the repo, then...

```console
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py <expression>
```
